# mlp-train tutorial for EuChemS Chemical Biology School (1st EuChemS ChemBioLife School)

This repository contains material used for mlp-train tutorial
presented at EuChemS Chemical Biology School in July 2025. 

The examples here includes files for training MLIP:
- $[Mg(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$ complex (Example 1),
- Diels Alder reaction in gas phase using donwhill sampling (Example 2)
- Diels Alder reaction in gas phase using metadynamics (Example 3).

The detailed instructions for the tutorial and more examples can be found in  ``MLIP_tutorial.pdf`` file.
